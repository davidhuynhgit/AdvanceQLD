## Project specification
:page_with_curl: **SCENARIO:**

The allocation of public money (obtained from the public via taxes) is a politically sensitive activity with governments regularly coming under scrutiny for how this money is spent. A respected media organisation is looking into the Queensland Government's Advance Queensland program. The resulting story could be a "good news" story reporting on the success of the program, however if inappropriate spending or irregularities are found, it could become a story that is critical of the scheme, and potentially the Government.

As a data analyst, your task is to analyse the publicly available data on the distribution of the funds over time. You are looking for patterns that may support the "good news" story, or which may be a cause for concern. It is up to you how deeply you explore the data, but at a minimum you should look at:
- The balance between South-East Queensland and the remainder of the state (regional Queensland).
- How distributions align with the objectives of the scheme which may include supporting specified groups of people.

:sparkling_heart: **ETHICAL APPROACH:**

You are expected to be fair and ethical in your analysis, and therefore the insights that you draw should take into account contextual factors. You should avoid simplistic assumptions like assuming all groups and activities should receive equal funding. For example, disproportionate funding may be appropriate due to social circumstances or the costs involved in a particular activity. Further, benefits to Queensland may come in different forms. For example, cultural benefits cannot be directly compared to economic benefits.

:dart: **ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS:**

- Identify high quality questions that when answered may be helpful in addressing the scenario above
- Obtain the data in JSON form from the Guardian API.
- Clean and filter the data as appropriate
- Analyse the data in a way that answers your questions and ultimately addresses the concern in the scenario
- Visualise your results in a meaningful way that is helpful in making visible key findings
- Provide a detailed summary of the insights found and how they address the original questions and scenario
